### __Android__
If you want to learn Android from scratch, I would recommend the official source i.e. Google.

__[Google Developers Training Course for Android](https://developers.google.com/training/android/)__
- It is the best place to learn Android as it covers from the basics to advanced level courses. Almost all of the courses here are hosted on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 
- [Associate Android Developer Certification](https://developers.google.com/training/certification/associate-android-developer/) - Google Developer Certification run via Udacity
- Nanodegrees in Android
  - [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
  - [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

### __IoT (Embedded Systems)__
  Learning C or Python X
  Choose a Development Platform: 1) Raspberry-Pi (most beginner-friendly) 2) Arduino 3) BeagleBone Black 4) DragonBoard X
  Re-invent the wheel: device drivers
  Compiler: 
  Operating System: 
  Chip architecture: ARM, AVR, PIC
  Source control: 
  
  #### *For Hobbyists*
  ##### Step 1: Choose a Development Platform: 1) Raspberry-Pi or 2) Arduino 
  Note that there are a lot more development platforms out there (such as BeagleBone Black, DragonBoard etc.), but the above two are the most beginner-friendly.
  
  ##### Step 2: Brush up on Python (if you chose Raspberry-Pi) or C (if you chose Arduino) programming
  Skip this step if you already know the target programming language fairly well.
