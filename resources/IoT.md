## __IoT (Embedded Systems)__ <img width="30" src="https://goapl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IOT_Icon_circle.png">
  From smart thermostats to Amazon Echo home assistant, electronic devices are becoming more and more interconnected over the web. Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of devices that collect data from built-in sensors and transfer that data over an information network, enabling us to monitor those physical devices remotely. 
  
  Turns out, building your very own IoT device isn't hard at all! Follow the steps in [The Hobbyist Guide](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#the-hobbyist-guide-) to get your feet wet in creating your first smart device! 
  
  If you are a hobbyist aspiring to be an embedded systems professional, follow [The Professional Guide](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#the-professional-guide-) to learn all about how the operating system, compiler and the hardware chip work together in an embedded system!
  
  ### *The Hobbyist Guide* <img width="30" src="https://d30y9cdsu7xlg0.cloudfront.net/png/120701-200.png" alt="Hobbyists">
  #### Step 1. Choose a Development Platform: 1) Raspberry-Pi or 2) Arduino 
  Note that there are a lot more development platforms out there (such as BeagleBone Black, DragonBoard etc.), but the above two are the most beginner-friendly.
  
  #### Step 2. Brush up on Python (if you chose Raspberry-Pi) or C (if you chose Arduino) programming
  Skip this step if you already know the target programming language fairly well.
