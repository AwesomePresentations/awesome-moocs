[Fundamentals](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#fundamentals-): Whether you have prior knowledge about AI or machine learning, this module will help you learn various kinds of ML algorithms (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcemnt learning techniques). 

There are also many ML courses designed with particular applications in mind -- the following modules contain courses that teaches concepts in each specialization and ML techniques that help achieve those tasks. 
1. [Computer Vision Specialization](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#computer-vision-specialization-) 

2. [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#natural-language-processing-specialization-)

3. [Stock Trading Specialization](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#stock-trading-specialization-)

4. [Robotics Specialization](https://github.com/Tapia17/awesome-moocs#robotics-specialization-)

### *What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning?*
<img width="800" src="https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Deep_Learning_Icons_R5_PNG.jpg.png">
The diagram above illustrates the relationship between the three buzzwords - Machine Learning is ONE, but not the only,  approach to to Articial Intelligence problems. Machine learning algorithms can be generally catagorized into 4 different settings -- supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and activie learning (which will not be covered in this list). Deep Learning is a model that can be used in supervised learning, in unsupervised learning, in reinforcement learning.
